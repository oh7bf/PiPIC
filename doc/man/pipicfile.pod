=head1 NAME

pipicfile -  print files from PiPIC

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<pipicfile> B<-a> i2c address [B<-f> file address | B<-e>] [B<-w> data] 
[B<-h>] [B<-v>] [B<-V>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<pipicfile> is used to read files from a PiPIC processor on i2c bus 
connected to Raspberry Pi. If no file address is give, all the addresses
are printed. Use B<-v> to see the register names.

=head1 OPTIONS

B<-a> chip address on i2c bus

B<-f> file address 

B<-e> print EEPROM content

B<-w> write data to EEPROM, first address followed by byte

B<-h> display a short help text

B<-v> verbose

B<-V> print version

=head1 EXAMPLE

Read all file and register addresses from PiPIC with chip address 0x26

pipicfile -a 26

Print register names with content

pipicfile -a 26 -v

Write 0xF8 to EEPROM address 0x10

pipicfile -a 26 -w 10F8

=head1 WARNING

No checking is done where the query data is written. Could make some hardware 
unusable.
