The battery voltage is measured with a bipolar transistor circuit and the
A/D-converter result from the PIC12F675 needs to be calibrated if the voltage
value needs to be known. The calibration depends on temperature of the 
transistor used 2N3904 and this is close to the ambient temperature.

For example calibration done at room temperature was done with 12 V lead 
acid battery of capacity 1.2 Ah while the battery was running empty.

The readings are written to a file 'voltcal.txt'. The result can be plotted
with gnuplot

gnuplot> plot "voltcal.txt" using 1:2

Next we define linear fitting function

gnuplot> f(x)=a*(1023-x)

and fit the function to the data

fit f(x) "voltcal.txt" using 1:2 via a

Now the fitted parameter 'a' can be used for VOLTCAL in the configuration 
file.

If only one voltage point is available approximative calibration constant
can be calculated from

VOLTCAL=U/(1023-AN3)

The temperature dependence of VOLTCAL can be taken into account if the ambient
temperature is measured. For example 

temperature[C]   voltcal
+6.00            0.02585
+12.94           0.02454
+20              0.02346
+33.9            0.02232

These are written to a file 'volttemp.txt' and plotted with

gnuplot> plot "volttemp.txt" using 1:2

A fitting function is defined and fitted to the data

gnuplot> f(x)=a*x*x+b*x+c 

gnuplot> fit f(x) "volttemp.txt" using 1:2 via a, b, c

The result can be plotted with

gnuplot> plot "volttemp.txt" using 1:2, f(x)

The fitted parameters 'a', 'b' and 'c' can be used for VOLTTEMP in the 
configuration file.
