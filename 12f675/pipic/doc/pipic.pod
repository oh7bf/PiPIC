=head1 NAME

pipic -  send commands and read data from PIC

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<pipic> B<-a> i2c address [B<-c> command [B<-d> data b|w|2w] | B<-r> b|w|2w] 
[B<-h>] [B<-v>] [B<-V>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<pipic> is used to send commands to a PIC processor on i2c bus connected
to Raspberry Pi. The commands are simply one data byte and can be followed by
one to four bytes of parameter data. The PIC processor has the necessary
command interpretation loop programmed in. After the command has been
executed the possible results can be read with option B<-r>. 

=head1 OPTIONS

B<-a> chip address on i2c bus

B<-c> send command and parameter bytes to PIC

B<-d> byte, word or two words of data after command byte

B<-r> read byte, word or two words from PIC

B<-h> display a short help text

B<-v> verbose

B<-V> print version

=head1 WARNING

No checking is done where the data is written. Could make some hardware 
unusable.
