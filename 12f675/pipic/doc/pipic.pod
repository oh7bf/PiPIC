=head1 NAME

pipic -  send commands and read data from PIC

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<pipic> B<-a> i2c address [B<-c> command [B<-d> data b|w|2w] | B<-r> b|w|2w] 
[B<-h>] [B<-v>] [B<-V>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<pipic> is used to send commands to a PIC processor on i2c bus connected
to Raspberry Pi. The commands are simply one data byte and can be followed by
one to four bytes of parameter data. The PIC processor has the necessary
command interpretation loop programmed in. After the command has been
executed the possible results can be read with option B<-r>. 

=head1 OPTIONS

B<-a> chip address on i2c bus

B<-c> send command byte to PIC

B<-d> byte, word or two words of data after command byte

B<-r> read byte, word or two words from PIC

B<-h> display a short help text

B<-v> verbose

B<-V> print version

=head1 COMMANDS

0x00 do nothing

0x01 0xNN read byte from file and write it to output buffer

0x10 clear GPIO0=0 output

0x11 clear GPIO1=0 output

0x14 clear GPIO4=0 output

0x15 clear GPIO5=0 output

0x20 set GPIO0=1 output

0x21 set GPIO1=1 output

0x24 set GPIO4=1 output

0x25 set GPIO5=1 output

0x30 0xNN write byte to GPIO

0x31 0xNN write byte to TRISIO

0x40 read analog input AN0

0x41 read analog input AN1

0x43 read analog input AN3

=head1 EXAMPLE

Set GPIO5 output to "1", chip address 0x26 (or 38) and command 0x25 (or 37)

B<pipic> B<-a> 38 B<-c> 37 

This assumes that GP5 has been configured as digital output.

=head1 WARNING

No checking is done where the data is written. Could make some hardware 
unusable.
