pipicpowerd -  monitor and control Raspberry Pi power supply with i2c

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<pipicpowerd> 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<pipicpowerd> is used to monitor and control Raspberry Pi power supply
with i2c bus. Initially the power is applied to the Raspberry Pi by pushing
the red button on the power supply. The daemon is started with command

B<service> I<pipicpowerd> I<start>

and can be stopped any time with

B<service> I<pipicpowerd> I<stop>

The operation of the daemon can be checked from the log file.
At the start four test bytes are written to the power supply and read back.
If this data flow test fails the daemon exits. One reason for this
failure could be that the internal counter of PIC was not yet reset with
command B<pipic> B<-a> 26 B<-c> 50.
Otherwise the event triggered
tasks on the PIC are disabled and the internal timer is read. In the main
loop the battery voltage is read at predetermined intervals. During the 
reading the red LED on the power supply is turned on. If the battery
voltage is too low the power supply is programmed to a delayed power down and 
the shutdown(8) command is called to put the Raspberry Pi into a halt state.
Note that high value read from PIC means low battery voltage because of
the inverting transistor circuit.

The event register from the PIC is read at programmed intervals to see if
the power button has been pressed. If this is the case the red LED is turned
on and if the button is pressed again the shut down and delayed power down is 
initiated. If the file I</var/lib/pipicpowerd/wakeup> exits the PIC is 
programmed to wake up later in future at the given time. The time delay
depends on how accurately the PIC internal counter cycle length is known.
This can be determined for example with command 
B<pipictest> B<-a> 26 B<-c> B<-n> 10000. 

The shut down and power down can be initiated by sending HUP signal to 
the daemon with B<kill> B<-s> I<SIGHUP>. 
The file I</var/lib/pipicpowerd/pwrdown> has to exists for HUP signal power
down to be executed.
