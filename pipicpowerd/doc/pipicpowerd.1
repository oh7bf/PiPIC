.SH "NAME"
pipicpowerd \-  monitor and control Raspberry Pi power supply with i2c
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
\&\fBpipicpowerd\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBpipicpowerd\fR is used to monitor and control Raspberry Pi power supply
with i2c bus. Initially the power is applied to the Raspberry Pi by pushing
the red button on the power supply. The daemon is started with command
.PP
\&\fBservice\fR \fIpipicpowerd\fR \fIstart\fR
.PP
and can be stopped any time with
.PP
\&\fBservice\fR \fIpipicpowerd\fR \fIstop\fR
.PP
The operation of the daemon can be checked from the log file.
At the start four test bytes are written to the power supply and read back.
If this data flow test fails the daemon exits. One reason for this
failure could be that the internal counter of \s-1PIC\s0 was not yet reset with
command \fBpipic\fR \fB\-a\fR 26 \fB\-c\fR 50.
Otherwise the event triggered tasks on the \s-1PIC\s0 are disabled and the 
internal timer is read. If the file \fI/var/lib/pipicpowerd/pwrup\fR exists
the \s-1PIC\s0 internal timer is used to estimate time now and the system time is
set accordingly.
.PP
In the main
loop the battery voltage is read at predetermined intervals. During the 
reading the red \s-1LED\s0 on the power supply is turned on. If the battery
voltage is too low the power supply is programmed to a delayed power down and 
the \fIshutdown\fR\|(8) command is called to put the Raspberry Pi into a halt state.
Note that high value read from \s-1PIC\s0 means low battery voltage because of
the inverting transistor circuit.
.PP
The event register from the \s-1PIC\s0 is read at programmed intervals to see if
the power button has been pressed. If this is the case the red \s-1LED\s0 is turned
on and if the button is pressed again the shut down and delayed power down is 
initiated. If the file \fI/var/lib/pipicpowerd/wakeup\fR exists the \s-1PIC\s0 is 
programmed to wake up later in future at the given time. The time delay
depends on how accurately the \s-1PIC\s0 internal counter cycle length is known.
This can be determined for example with command 
\&\fBpipictest\fR \fB\-a\fR 26 \fB\-c\fR \fB\-n\fR 10000.
.PP
The shut down and power down can be initiated by sending \s-1HUP\s0 signal to 
the daemon with \fBkill\fR \fB\-s\fR \fI\s-1SIGHUP\s0\fR. 
The file \fI/var/lib/pipicpowerd/pwrdown\fR has to exists for \s-1HUP\s0 signal power
down to be executed.

.PP
\&\fI/var/lib/pipicpowerd/sleeptime\fR   If this file exists and has hh:mm, this time is used to start system shutdown and power down.
.PP
\&\fI/var/lib/pipicpowerd/volts\fR      Most recent battery voltage.
.PP
\&\fI/var/lib/pipicpowerd/wakeup\fR     Next wakeup time hh:mm.
.PP
\&\fI/var/log/pipicpowerd.log\fR        Log file.
.PP
\&\fI/var/run/pipicpowerd.pid\fR        \s-1PID\s0 file.
.PP
The configuration file can have following parameters.
.PP
\&\fI\s-1BUTTONINT\s0\fR
Push button reading interval in seconds. When the daemon is running the
push button can be used to initiate system shutdown and power down.
.PP
\&\fI\s-1CONFDELAY\s0\fR
The system shutdown and power down needs to be confirmed by a second button
press. This is the waiting time in seconds for confirmation button press.
.PP
\&\fI\s-1FORCEPOWEROFF\s0\fR
Force power off after given \s-1PIC\s0 counter cycles. This can be used as a 
hardware watchdog for RPi power. If set to zero the value is ignored.
.PP
\&\fI\s-1FORCEPOWERUP\s0\fR
Force power up after given \s-1PIC\s0 counter cycles. This can be used as a 
hardware watchdog to wake up after forced power off. If set to zero this 
value is ignored.
.PP
\&\fI\s-1FORCERESET\s0\fR
If set force reset of \s-1PIC\s0 counter if initial i2c dataflow test fails. The \s-1PIC\s0
counter needs to be reset after power cycling of the \s-1PIC\s0.
.PP
\&\fI\s-1LOGLEVEL\s0\fR
Log level 0=debug messages, 1=system commands, 2=operation messages, 
3=status messages and 4=errors/warnings.
.PP
\&\fI\s-1LOWBATTERY\s0\fR 
Low battery voltage level 0 \- 1023. Due to the inverting transistor 
circuit from battery to \s-1AN3\s0 high value means low voltage at battery.
Reaching this level will initiate automatic shutdown.
.PP
\&\fI\s-1PICYCLE\s0\fR 
\&\s-1PIC\s0 internal timer cycle period in seconds. Needed to estimate number of
\&\s-1PIC\s0 counter cycles to wake up the Raspberry Pi again. This can checked with
