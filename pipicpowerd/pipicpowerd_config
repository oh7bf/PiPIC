# battery voltage reading interval [s]

# low battery voltage level 0 - 1023, due to the inverting transistor 
# circuit from battery to AN3 high value means low voltage at battery, 
# reaching this level will initiate automatic shutdown

# use only, at room temperature 20 - 25 C it is better to use VOLTCAL only

#VDROP 0.4

# minimum operating charge level for battery, should be more than 50 %

# if set solar panel is used to charge the battery, in cycling power up

# /var/lib/pipicpowerd/pdowntime files this switch will prevent power
# down if the battery has been fully charged to dissipate part of the 
# energy that can not be stored to the battery, this only for small
