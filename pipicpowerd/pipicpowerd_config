# battery voltage reading interval [s]
VOLTINT 300

# low battery voltage level 0 - 1023, due to the inverting transistor 
# circuit from battery to AN3 high value means low voltage at battery, 
# reaching this level will initiate automatic shutdown

# temperature dependent calibration constants for the voltage, for outdoor
# use only, at room temperature 20 - 25 C it is better to use VOLTCAL only

# minimum operating charge level for battery, should be more than 50 %
# for longer battery life, ideally 70 % could be used
# user is warned when reaching this level and automatic shutdown is started
MINBATTLEVEL 50

# maximum battery voltage during charging, higher voltage than this could
# damage the battery is applied for long time
