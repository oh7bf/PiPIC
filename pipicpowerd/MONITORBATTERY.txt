The battery status can be printed on the screen during the login by adding 
the commands from the file 'battery.sh' to the end of '.bashrc'. 

The 'filterlog' script can be used to extract the data from the log file
'pipicpowerd.log'. This data can then be plotted with

gnuplot> set title "Battery voltage"
gnuplot> set xdata time
gnuplot> set timefmt "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"
gnuplot> set format x "%m-%d\n%H:%M"
gnuplot> set xlabel "Date"
gnuplot> set ylabel "U[V]"
gnuplot> set xrange ["2014-04-24 21:00":"2014-04-27 18:00"]
gnuplot> plot "battery27Apr2014.txt" using 1:4
gnuplot> set term png
gnuplot> set output "battery27Apr2014.png"
gnuplot> plot "battery27Apr2014.txt" using 1:4
