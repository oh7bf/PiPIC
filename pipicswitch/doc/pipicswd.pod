=head1 NAME

pipicswd -  monitor and control Raspberry Pi power switch with i2c

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<pipicswd> 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<pipicswd> is used to monitor and control Raspberry Pi power switch 
with i2c bus. 

B<service> I<pipicswd> I<start>

and can be stopped any time with

B<service> I<pipicswd> I<stop>

The operation of the daemon can be checked from the log file.
At the start four test bytes are written to the switch and read back.
If this data flow test fails the daemon exits. One reason for this
failure could be that the internal counter of PIC was not yet reset with
command B<pipic> B<-a> 27 B<-c> 50.

In the main loop the switch status is read at predetermined intervals.
